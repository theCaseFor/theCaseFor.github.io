    <p><br><i>Free will.</i><br><br>Few topics in the broad catalog of philosophy are as personal and misunderstood in it's implications... and it's under these circumstances that I eagerly detail what science (and common sense) have to say about it.<br><br>Unfortunately most public debates on the matter simmer down to a game of semantics, so in avoidance of that I preface this discussion with a definition of the term "free will". <br><br> Simply put, free will is the notion that after traveling back to any singular instance of time (where you were making a decision), you could have chosen differently. It's the idea that last week, when you were standing in line at Starbucks and made the split decision audible to go for the white chocolate mocha as opposed to the pumpkin spice latte, you could have done otherwise. The delicious reward is preceded by none other than your own authorship in making that moment happen.<br><br><i>This ideology couldn't be further from the truth.</i><br><br>Philosophical discourse reveals three positions held on this subject: <i>Libertarianism</i>, <i>Compatibalism</i>, and <i>Determinism</i>. In the broad sense, libertarianism claims that any individual is free from genetic/ environmental influences and is capable of making whatever decision they please at any instance of time. Any respectable neuroscientist, physicist, philosopher, or middle schooler would denounce this perspective so it's not even worth commenting on. Determinism proposes that all of life is cause and effect, under which we have no control. We are composed of atoms, each of which moves under the forces of nature, eventually yielding sentient beings and conscious states of mind. This is easily mapped on to reality and ties in well with models of evolution. Finally, compatablism states that free will and determinism are mutually compatible without being logically inconsistent.<br><br><i> Sounds great, but what does reality have to say?</i><br><br>Let's dissect the case of choosing between the white chocolate mocha and the pumpkin spice latte. It's human nature to percieve your decision as the end result of your own volition, but substantial evidence shows this is an illusion and here's why:<br><br> In the 1980's neuroscientist Bejamin Libet conducted an experiment which entailed connecting EEG electrodes to subjects brains. He would then proceed to ask them to raise either their left or right hand. In other words he was forcing them to make a decision. In 80% of cases, Libet was aware of the decision they had made as early as 7 seconds before they were even aware of the choice they had made due to patterns in brain activity. This fueled controversy amongst the philosophical and scientific community, but nontheless was one of the first emprical sets of data that we could use to dismiss the idea of free will. Moving on, whether it is newtonian models of physics or quantum mechanics, you simple do not get free will. Newtonian physics descibes the world in strictly cause and effect terms, and has yielded beautiful results in innovation around the world today so we know IT WORKS. Although quantum mechanics is more elusive, the location of a particle can be described using statistical models. In other words, randomness... and randomness doesn't get you free will either, it just gets you randomness. My point in all of this is, why would humans be exempt from the laws of physics which govern the universe around us? How are we subject to a different set of mechanics than literally every other object or particle in this univserse? To say that we have free will, to say that we have the ability to pick left versus right in any which way we please at any time, would be to say that humans possess a power using our minds to influence particles in a manner that would create the precision brain state allowing  a preproposed decision to manifest itself in reality.<br><br><i>Think about that.</i><br><br>That my friends, would make you a god. Consider the case of Charles Whitman, a student at the University of Texas at Austin who was presumabbly a normal child with a normal upbringing. Suddenly, as anecdotal recounts recall, he began to exhibit abnormal, violent behaviour. Shortly before embarking on a shooting rampage, amounting to one of largest tradgedies in the nation, he wrote a letter asking for an autopsy to be done on his brain after he died on the spot of the shooting. He believed there was a brain tumor responsible for his behaviour. Sure enough they found exactly what he suspected. There are numerous cases of this occuring throughout history and it is critical that we as a society understand the evidence that lies before us.
