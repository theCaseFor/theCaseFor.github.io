    <p><br><i>Free will.</i><br><br>Few topics in the broad catalog of philosophy are as personal and misunderstood in it's implications... and it's under these circumstances that I eagerly detail what science (and common sense) have to say about it.<br><br>Unfortunately most public debates on the matter simmer down to a game of semantics, so in avoidance of that I preface this discussion with a definition of the term "free will". <br><br> Simply put, free will is the notion that after traveling back to any singular instance of time (where you were making a decision), you could have chosen differently. It's the idea that last week, when you were standing in line at Starbucks and made the split decision audible to go for the white chocolate mocha as opposed to the pumpkin spice latte, you could have done otherwise. The delicious reward is preceded by none other than your own authorship in making that moment happen.<br><br><i>This ideology couldn't be further from the truth.</i><br><br>Philosophical discourse reveals three positions held on this subject: <i>Libertarianism</i>, <i>Compatibalism</i>, and <i>Determinism</i>. In the broad sense, libertarianism claims that any individual is free from genetic/ environmental influences and is capable of making whatever decision they please at any instance of time. Any respectable neuroscientist, physicist, philosopher, or middle schooler would denounce this perspective so it's not even worth commenting on. Determinism propses that all of life is cause and effect, under which we have no control. We are composed of atoms, each of which moves under the forces of nature, eventually yielding sentient beings and conscious states of mind. This is easily mapped on to reality and ties in well with models of evolution. Finally, compatablism states that free will and determinism are mutually compatible without being logically inconsistent.<br><br><i> Sounds great, but what does reality have to say?</i><br><br>
