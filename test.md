    <p><br><i>Free will.</i><br><br>Few topics in the broad catalog of philosophy are as personal and misunderstood in it's implications... and it's under these circumstances that I eagerly detail what science has to say about it.<br><br>Unfortunately most public debates on the matter simmer down to a game of semantics. With that being said, I would like to preface this discussion with a definition of the term "free will". <br><br> Simply put, free will is the notion that you could have traveled back to any singular instance of time and have been able to choose differently.
