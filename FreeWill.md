    <p><br><i>Free will.</i><br><br>Few topics in the broad catalog of philosophy are as personal and misunderstood in its implications... and it's under these circumstances that I eagerly detail what science (and common sense) reveal about it.<br><br>Unfortunately most public debates on the matter simmer down to a game of semantics, so in avoidance of that I preface this discussion with a definition of the term "free will". <br><br> Simply put, free will is the notion that after traveling back to any singular instance of time (one where you were making a decision), you could have chosen differently. It's the idea that last week, when you were standing in line at Starbucks and made the split decision audible to go for the white chocolate mocha as opposed to the pumpkin spice latte, you could have done otherwise. The delicious treat is preceded by none other than your own authorship in making that moment happen.<br><br><i>This ideology couldn't be further from the truth.</i><br><br>Philosophical discourse reveals three positions held on this subject: <i>Libertarianism</i>, <i>Compatibalism</i>, and <i>Determinism</i>. In the broad sense, libertarianism claims that any individual is free from genetic/ environmental influences and is capable of making whatever decision they please at any instance of time. Any respectable neuroscientist, physicist, philosopher, or middle schooler would denounce this perspective so it's not even worth commenting on. Determinism proposes that all of life is cause and effect, under which we have no control. We are composed of atoms, each of which moves under the forces of nature, eventually yielding sentient beings and conscious states of mind. This is easily mapped on to reality and ties in well with models of evolution. Finally, compatablism states that free will and determinism are mutually compatible without being logically inconsistent.<br><br><i> Sounds great, but what does reality have to say?</i><br><br>Let's dissect the case of choosing between the white chocolate mocha and the pumpkin spice latte. It's human nature to percieve your decision as the end result of your own volition, but substantial evidence shows this is an illusion and here's why:<br><br> In the 1980's neuroscientist Bejamin Libet conducted an experiment which entailed connecting EEG electrodes to subjects brains. He would then proceed to ask them to raise either their left or right hand. In other words he was forcing them to make a decision. In 80% of cases, Libet was aware of the decision they had made as early as 7 seconds before they were even aware of the choice they had made due to patterns in brain activity. This fueled controversy amongst the philosophical and scientific community, but nontheless was one of the first emprical sets of data that we could use to dismiss the idea of free will. Moving on, whether it is newtonian models of physics or quantum mechanics, you simple do not get free will. Newtonian physics descibes the world in strictly cause and effect terms, and has yielded beautiful results in innovation around the world today so we know IT WORKS. Although quantum mechanics is more elusive, the location of a particle can be described using statistical models. In other words, randomness... and randomness doesn't get you free will either, it just gets you randomness. My point in all of this is, why would humans be exempt from the laws of physics which govern the universe around us? How are we subject to a different set of mechanics than literally every other object or particle in this univserse? To say that we have free will... to say that we have the ability to pick left versus right in any which way we please at any time, would be to say that human beings possess a power within our minds which can influence particles in a manner that would create the precision brain state allowing  a preproposed decision to manifest itself in reality.<br><br><i>Think about that. This, my friends, would make you an mf god.</i><br><br>Consider the case of Charles Whitman, a student at the University of Texas at Austin who was presumabbly a normal child with a normal upbringing. Suddenly, as anecdotal recounts recall, he began to exhibit abnormal, violent behaviour. Shortly before embarking on a shooting rampage, amounting to one of largest tradgedies in the nation, he wrote a letter asking for an autopsy to be done on his brain after he died on the spot of the shooting. He believed there was a brain tumor responsible for his behaviour. Sure enough they found exactly what he suspected. There are numerous cases of this occuring throughout history and it is critical that we as a society understand the evidence that lies before us.<br><br>Once the curtains of the illusion are spread apart, and the insurmountable evidence is illuminated, it becomes increasingly evident that determinism is the only idealogy that is sensible and maps on to reality. Mankind does what he wills but does not will what he wills. What you choose to do was chosen for you through a wilderness of prior causality.<br><br><i>What do you do after realizing you are a biochemical puppet?<br><br></i>This is where majority of the misunderstanding lies and more often than not, the point is missed. The immediate reaction for some who find out that it wasn't their own self-manifested volition that lead them to graduate college or lose 50 pounds in a year is to be defeated. If everything is cause and effect, why not sit back and just see what happens? This in itself is an action that was causually determined and has it's own set of consequences. Weight gain, depression, etc. To say that you have no control over your own actions, isn't to say that your actions do not matter. For example, had Martin Luther King Jr. not causally become the brilliant poet and pubic figure he was, slavery may still be prevelant today. Efforts, intentions, motivation are all still just as important, the only difference under this framework is that they are no longer produced on your end, rather a long chain of causality entirely out of your hands. They still lead to change and progress in the world around us.<br><br><i>So Ted Bundy didn't commit the crime, it was his atoms?</i><br><br>Simply put, yes. This then puts forth the questions of blame and retribution. How can such an evil killer not be at fault for his wrongdoing? This again misses the point. Concepts of blame, vengence, retribution, pride, and arrogance don't have a basis in reality. At what level to molecules become suceptible to blame? This doesn't mean that we don't lock the Ted Bundy's of the world up for eternity or send them to be executed for the greater good of humanity. That is a seperate discussion. But blame does not make sense in this world and neither does pride. This can be freeing, and many would argue that determinism gives us the same good stuff of life, while removing the pride and blame of stuff. I am in favor of this mindset.<br><br> The United States justice system currently presupposes that we as humans have the ability to will our actions into existence. This is why the argument by lawyers "it wasn't my client's fault, it was his atoms'" doesn't work. This is a large presupposition and I contest that it is a morally incorrect one. Locking someone up due to a crime that could not have been avoided due to the causal nature of the universe shouldn't always be warrented. Programs to reconfigure proper behaviour would, in most cases, would be a proper and more ethical means of resolving patterns of crime. <br><br>While there is a lot to chew on in this passage, and I will touch on this more in the future, it is becoming increasingly apparent to me that the illusion of free will must be broken. Yes, the Jeffrey Dahmers of the world should be locked up to protect society but in more personally relevant cases such interpersonal conflict, shortcomings of goals, so forth we can learn to take on a new perspective. One that is free of personal/interpersonal blame and where pride becomes a non sequitur.<br><br> My contention is that determinism is a better model for society to live by once we collectively look beneath the surface of what truly is responsible for the good and evils in the world. Acknowledging that we are at mercy to the forces around us, brings immediate attention to the significance of the environment we surround ourselves in. Each of us is one of the myriad of inputs to another individual's system of consciousness. This opens up the realm of freedom each of us has. There is no telling how each of us might change over the years, what adventures await, and the stories to tell. Fatalism, blame, and pride can be put to rest.
