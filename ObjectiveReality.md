    <p><br><br>Nearly a decade ago, a curious American scientist at MIT would write a proof that would shake the world. The implications of the proof were so staggering that he recalls having to sit down and catch his breath. What could have been on that piece of paper to warrent the dismay of one of the most rational minds of our era?...<br><br>You, the reader, are more than likely reading this passage right now on a computer, phone, or tablet.<br><br><i>Let's go further.</i><br><br>You the reader, are using a force to hold up your phone, tablet, or computer to read this passage whether it be your hands or a table. This is simple newtonian physics, the force holding up your device is overcoming the force of gravity which allows it to stay up. This describes all of the world around us. Forces interacting to make objects move and so forth and we can visibly see all of this happening.<br><br><i>Let's dig deeper (bare with me here)</i><br><br>We visibly see all of these forces and interactions happening around us, and so the modern macro-level physics we have describes what we see (and does is very accurately).<br><br><i>But who ever said what we see is truth?</i><br><br>This is exactly what Donald Hoffman, the American qualitative psychologist, mathmatician, and computer scientist pondered nearly a decade ago. As time has progressed, where along the lines of physics and biology did we make the assumption that what we see is objective truth? Scientists made this assumption on a seemingly intuitive impulse: organisms that could see reality more accurately would have the survival advantage and thus be able to pass on their genes. Sounds fair, right?<br><br><i>Wrong.</i><br><br>To illustrate this point better, imagine a primordial organism, most of which would contain a primitive nervous system. This organism is able to see with the poor vision he has evolved to have. An approaching predator, such as a bear, might appear as a brown blob. A fall to the death might be percieved as another stepping stone. Now imagine a different organism of the same species, only this one has had a genetic mutation which encodes for better, more clear vision. He can see the bear, he can see the plunge to death. It's obvious that he has the survival advantage because he has evolved better vision and so he will be the one to pass the torch of 'superior' genetics. But just because he has better "vision" does not mean he can see more accurately...<br><br>Evolution is cheap. It cuts corners. The introduction of the genetic mutation responsible for the better vision means that the organism can now process external stimuli in a manner more fit for survival than the previous organism. It means what he sees is a rendering by the brain and just happens to entail more fitness payoffs than previous members of the species. Incoming Stimuli -> Brain Processes -> Concept of What We See. What we see is at the mercy of how the brain has been structured to process.<br><br><i>Over time we have not evolved to see the universe for how it is. Evolution had no reason to develop us to see the whole truth. We were formed for survival and what we see is not real, rather it is the output of the complicated CPU that is the brain.</i><br><br>At first glance, Hoffman was dismissed by many of his collegues and so he had to find a way to present his case in a more sensible way. Using game theory, machine learning, and his programming skillset, he was able to simulate his models of evolution hundreds of thousands of times. All models indicated the same thing: organisms that saw all of the truth simply died faster than organisms that saw a fabricated rendition of reality. Even those that saw the partial truth of reality did not have the survival advantage. It has been nearly ten years and his proofs are yet to be proven incorrect. Numerous instances in nature demonstrate his hypothesis and it is only now that scientists are starting to shit their pants.<br><br><i>What does this all mean and why are scientists shitting themselves?</i><br><br>
