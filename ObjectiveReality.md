    <p><br><br>Nearly a decade ago, a curious American scientist at MIT would write before his eyes a proof that would shake the world. The implications of the proof were so staggering that he recalls having to sit down and catch his breath. What could have been on that piece of paper to warrent the dismay of one of the most rational minds of our era?<br><br>You, the reader, are more than likely reading this passage right now on a computer, phone, or tablet.<br><br><i>Let's go further.</i><br><br>You the reader, are using a force to hold up your phone, tablet, or computer to read this passage whether it be your hands or a table. This is simple newtonian physics, the force holding up your device is overcoming the force of gravity which allows it to stay up. This describes all of the world around us. Forces interacting to make objects move and so forth and we can visibly see all of this happening.<br><br><i>Let's dig deeper (bare with me here)</i><br><br>We visibly see all of these forces and interactions happening around us, and so the modern macro-level physics we have describes what we see (and does is very accurately).<br><br><i>But who ever said what we see is truth?</i><br><br>This is exactly what Donald Hoffman, the American qualitative psychologist, mathmatician, and computer scientist pondered nearly a decade ago. As evolution progressed, when along the lines did we make the assumption that what we see is objective truth? Scientists made this assumption on a seemingly intuitive impulse: organisms that could see reality more accurately would have the survival advantage and thus be able to pass on their genes. Sounds fair, right?<br><br><i>Wrong.</i><br><br>
