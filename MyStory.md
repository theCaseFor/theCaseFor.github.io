    <p>As an honest disclaimer, there really isn't much to say on this.<br><br>I grew up under a protestant household, and from birth until the age of twenty, Christianity was simply all I knew. We went to church every Sunday as a family, prayed every morning and night (or tried to), and repeated in my ignorance. Under this doctrine, everything was going to be okay as long as I said the prayer that Jesus was my saviour. Everything happens for a reason, and was being supervised by the great surveillance system in the sky.
