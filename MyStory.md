    <p><i>As an honest disclaimer: I can't claim for this to be interesting, but I do hope it's valuable.</i><br><br>I grew up under a protestant household, and from birth until the age of twenty, Christianity was simply all I knew. We went to church every Sunday as a family, prayed every morning and night (or tried to), and repeated in an ignorant fashion. Under this doctrine, everything was going to be okay as long as I said the prayer that Jesus was my savior. Everything happens for a reason, and was being supervised by the great surveillance system in the sky.<br><br>I only became challenged in my faith once I came to college. So many of my friends, people I loved, who were not Christians would rot in hell for an eternity under biblical discourse and I was gravely concerned for their well being. I was posed with many questions from them which frankly I did not know the answer to. In other words, my ignorance was being exposed and this is what led me to explore truth for myself. In the wake of this I came to realize the dangers of organized religion. I found so much contradiction between the world we live in and scripture that there is no concievable way for a just god to hold us accountable to a blind belief amidst so much evidence in a secular world. By no means was this a comfortable process... I compare it to having the foundation upon which you've built your entire life upon being ripped out from underneath you.<br><br><i>But it was totally worth it.</i><br><br>In the wake of this I learned of the spirit of science... having a question, forming an answer, presenting that answer publicly to have it scrutinized, tested, and remodified for none other than the sake of truth itself. And it's with this mindset that I present this website. I hope in any and all passages I write, they be criticized for their shortcomings or inaccuracies. While I do this for the sake of truth and learning itself, this is not all that comes from learning of the univserse around us. I argue that doing so gives us a better understanding of morality and direction and this is why it is so damn important for people to be on the same page regarding this stuff. I go so far as to say that the lack of awareness of the goal of existence is the root of many of the evils in this world.
