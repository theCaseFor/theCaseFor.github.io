    <p><i>As an honest disclaimer: I can't claim for this to be interesting, but I do hope it's valuable.</i><br><br>I grew up under a protestant household, and from birth until the age of twenty, Christianity was simply all I knew. We went to church every Sunday as a family, prayed every morning and night (or tried to), and repeated in an ignorant fashion. Under this doctrine, everything was going to be okay as long as I said the prayer that Jesus was my savior. Everything happens for a reason, and was being supervised by the great surveillance system in the sky.<br><br>I only became challenged in my faith once I came to college. So many of my friends, people I loved, were not Christians and would rot in hell for an eternity under biblical discourse and I was gravely concerned for their well being. I was posed with many questions from them which frankly I did not know the answer to. In other words, my ignorance was being exposed and this is what led me to explore truth for myself. In the wake of this I came to realize the dangers of organized religion. I found so much contradiction between the world we live in and scripture that there is no concievable way for a just god to hold us accountable to a blind belief amidst so much evidence in a secular world. By no means was this a comfortable process... I describe it as having the foundation upon which you've built your entire life upon being ripped out from underneath you.<br><br><i>But it was totally worth it.</i><br><br>In the wake of this I learned of the spirit of science... having a question, forming an answer, presenting that answer publicly to have it scrutinized, tested, and remodified for none other than the sake of truth itself.<br><br> And it's with this mindset that I present this website.<br><br> I hope in any and all passages I write, they be questioned for their shortcomings or inaccuracies for no other purpose than to reach understanding. While I do this for the sake of truth and learning itself, this is not all that comes from learning of the univserse around us. I argue that doing so gives us a better understanding of morality and direction and this is why it is so damn important for people to be on the same page regarding this stuff. I go so far as to say that the lack of awareness of the goal of existence is the root of many of the evils in this world.<br><br>Anway, I also do this simply beacuse I love it. Everyday is a new adventure to form another question and find an answer, where religion gave me nothing other than an answer that couldn't be questioned. I've seen so much personal development in myself along this journey. I'm eager to hear of peoples' stories, engage in discussion, and enjoy the small, everyday pleasures of life with the close group I keep around me because frankly, life is short.<br><br>It's undeniable that we live in a remarkable universe. One where we have the consciousness to stare back at the stars from which we were made from. I choose to relish in it, learn from it and it gives me the great pleasure to share my passion with you. <br><br>    -- JR
