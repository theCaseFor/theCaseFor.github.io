    <p><br>One of the reasons I felt it was necessary to write out my sentiments on matters (such as objective reality, free will , etc) is because, admittedly, I haven't been successful in convincing people of the immediate implications they have in the world around us through just conversation. I often get asked after voicing my thoughts the following -><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the point of the existential banter?"<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't you just live life dude?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're going to waste your life..."<br><br>While I try not to be dismissive of these suspicions, this is a frustrating dialogue for me because I so clearly see the benefit of coming to terms with the nature of existence ( as with many who share my secular perspective ). If one can not answer the questions, "what am I doing in life?", "what is the point?", etc, upon what basis can they justify their next decision or advice toward someone else? If we do not come to terms with existential inquiry, we all fall victim to the sheep mentality where anything goes.<br><br>As we delve into the philosophy of morality, I hope to structure the following passage in a way that illuminates the ethical fallacies in society today. Moreover, I wish to draw awareness to an abstraction of objective morality as a means to convice the reader of it's neccessity. With that being said...<br><br><i> Let's begin.</i><br><br> In 2008, two Afghan girls, Latefa (16 y.o.), and her sister, Shamsia (18 y.o), were walking to school when two men approaching on motorcycles caught their attention. As they stopped to focus their attention on the incoming strangers, Shamsia's face was met with battery acid. In the midst of shouting and anguish, her sister Latefa, tried to help but also encountered the same misfortune... both were left in critical condition. As it just so happens, this heinous act was done under the name of the Taliban. Their ideology entails that women not attend school, or at least the same school as the males... in some cases, they are not even permitted to read. In order to prevent retaliation, battery acid is often used to blind little girls.<br><br> In many parts of Africa, as well as the middle east, it is common practice to mutilate the genetalia of young women in an effort to tame their sexuality. Mariam Kako, one of of the 200 million women who endured the misfortune, details the exerpience below:<br><br><p style="margin-left:25px; margin-right:85px; margin-bottom:0px" align="left">"I can remember everything, every little detail about that day, those moments. It’s all still in my head, where it happened, who held me down, the balcony above me. And how it was all masked by a party with gifts and music. I could see the regret in my mother’s eyes. But it was too late.”</p><br><br> Mariam was only 5 and her vivid recall is but a testimony to the psychological aftermath of grotesque procedures such as this. Now it's easy (and human tendency) to cast blame upon those who exhibit little to zero regard for human decency as with the perpatrators of the immoral acts mentioned above. You can well imagine news channels reporting of the <i>evil</i> and <i>wicked</i> nature of the people commiting these wrongdoings. Every sensible person watching would shake their heads in dismay. There would be a communal call for <i>retribution</i>. And this is how the tale typically goes.<br><br><i>We have failed to realize that reality is much more complex than this.</i><br><br>As shown in the free will argument, condmenation towards a conscious agent does not make sense. An individual cannot, by their own volition, yield "evil" thoughts and act upon them. Those "evil" thoughts would have to have been caused. While blame and retribution have shown to have some effects in the limiting irrationality in the world, I believe it's worth looking at the cause of what leads to the irrationality in the first place. This would nip the problem at the bud. Effectively, we want to attack the causal factors leading to evil effects... not blame evil effects hoping that it fixes the cause. So in the case of the unfortunate stories mentioned above, what was the justification (cause) behind the men who commit the crimes of assault and genital mutilation?<br><br><i>Morality</i><br><br>I'll first begin by sharing the philosophical challenges behind morality, and then propose a solution which we can call <i>objective morality</i> and thereby use it to make sense of the stories mentioned previosuly. Simply put, morality is the principles concerning right and wrong or good and bad behaviour. Now the problem, philosophically speaking, is given the materialistic world we which we live in, how can anything be intrinsically good or bad? How can you systematically prove that smacking the shit out of your friend isn't good in principle? This turns out to be a great challenge to philosphers and scientists alike. David Hume, a scottish historian and philosopher, detailed this impediment well in his novel <i>A Treatise of Human Nature</i>. His writings brought forth the is/ought distincation which explains how the world operates and is described strictly through "is" statements, and this is all we can know about the world. An "ought" statement simply cannot arise from an "is" unless a contingency is provided. To illustrate this point better consider the following phrase: "It <i>is</i> the case that it is raining outside, therefor I <i>ought</i> to put on a rain coat."<br><br>In principle, this statement is illogical. Just because it is raining outside, it does not necessarily follow that you should wear a rain coat. It would have to be known prior to the statement that you do not like to be cold and wet.<br><br><i>So what does this have to do with morality?</i><br><br> Well turns out, Hume was on to something bigger with this idea. Science can only describe the way in which the world <i>is</i>, not how it <i>ought</i> to be. All we can know is that we exist, nothing about science reveals <i>how we should</i> exist. If this isn't clear, pause for a moment and try to think of any scientific finding that reveals not how something works, but how it ought to work. We have no prerequisite (unless you believe in fairy tales or religion) to give us the initial condition required to grant humanity the ever alluring "ought" we desperately need.<br><br><i>Or do we?</i><br><br>In my quest for finding potential sources for the athiestic morality, I immediately turned to Sam Harris, a neuroscientist and philosopher who's literature and online content have had a profound impact on not only my life, but thousands around the world. He is one of the most revered public educators, followed not only by an eclectic fan base, but strong criticism in his pursuit for truth that more than often puts people out of their comfort zones. In his novel, <i>The Moral Landscape</i>, Harris attempts to give the world the rational behind an objective morality. In short, I was astoundingly unable to make it past the first chapter as his base assumption was one that I, and many others, percieve as not having the weight to bare the burden of philosophical challenge. Harris pruposes that since the entirety of humanity has an objective subjective preference for well being (this much I agree with), it warrents that we treat it as objective (this I do not). Just because everyone agrees on something, does not make it correct objectively. Consensus and democracy are not synonymous to intrinsic value. For example, if you had twenty people in a room and all 20 agreed that blue is the best color to paint the wall, that does not mean that blue is objectively the best color.<i>In principle</i> I cannot accept this propositon...<br><br><i> In practice</i>, Harris does an excellent job laying out the moral blueprint.<br><br>One of the greatest mysteries in science is how consiousness arises out of inanimate matter. It is this consciousness that gives us the euphoria of a first kiss, and the despair of losing someone dear to you. I argue, it's what makes life worth living. So it is only right that we base our morality around it, just as Harris makes the case for (get it?).<br><br> But wait... that's what the entire world has been doing... we've just done an <b>incredibly</b> shitty job.<br><br>
