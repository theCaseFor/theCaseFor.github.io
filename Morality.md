    <p><br>One of the reasons I felt it was necessary to write out my sentiments on matters (such as objective reality, free will , etc) is because, admittedly, I haven't been successful in convincing people of the immediate implications they have in the world around us through just conversation. I often get asked after voicing my thoughts the following -><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the point of the existential banter?"<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't you just live life dude?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're going to waste your life..."<br><br>While I try not to be dismissive of these suspicions, this is a particularly frustrating dialogue for me because I so clearly see the benefit of coming to terms with the nature of existence ( as with many who share my secular perspective ). If one can not answer the questions, "what am I doing in life?", "what is the point?", etc, upon what basis can they justify their next decision or advice toward someone else? If we do not come to terms with existential inquiry, we all fall victim to the sheep mentality where anything goes.<br><br>As we delve into the philosophy of morality, I hope to structure the following passage in a way that illuminates the ethical fallacies in society today. Moreover, I wish to draw awareness to an abstraction of objective morality as a means to convice the reader of it's neccessity.<i> With that being said, let's begin.</i><br><br> In 2008, two Afghan girls, Latefa (16 y.o.), and her sister, Shamsia (18 y.o), were walking to school when two men approaching on motorcycles caught their attention. As they stopped to focus their attention on the incoming strangers, Shamsia's face was met with battery acid. In the midst of shouting and anguish, her sister Latefa, tried to help but also encountered the same misfortune... both were left in critical condition. As it just so happens, this heinous act was done under the name of the Taliban. Their ideology entails that women not attend school, or at least the same school as the males... in some cases, they are not even permitted to read. In order to prevent retaliation, battery acid is often used to blind little girls.<br><br> In many parts of Africa, as well as the middle east, it is common practice to mutilate the genetalia of young women in an effort to tame their sexuality. Mariam Kako, one of of the 200 million women who endured the misfortune, details the exerpience below:<br><br><p style="margin-left:25px; margin-right:85px" align="left">"I can remember everything, every little detail about that day, those moments. It’s all still in my head, where it happened, who held me down, the balcony above me. And how it was all masked by a party with gifts and music. I could see the regret in my mother’s eyes. But it was too late.”</p><br><br> Mariam was only 5 and her vivid recall is but a testimony to the psychological damage post procedures such as this. Now it's easy (and human tendency) to cast blame upon those who exhibit little to zero regard for human decency as with the perpatrators of the immoral acts mentioned above. You can well imagine news channels reporting of the <i>evil</i> and <i>wicked</i> nature of the people commiting these wrongdoings. Every sensible person watching would shake their heads in dismay. There would be a communal call for <i>retribution</i>. And this is how the tale typically goes.<br><br><i>We have failed to realize that reality is much more complex than this.</i><br><br>As shown in the free will argument, condmenation towards a conscious agent does not make sense. An individual cannot, by their own volition, yield "evil" thoughts and act upon them. Those "evil" thoughts would have to have been caused. While blame and retribution have shown to have some effects in the limiting irrationality in the world, I believe it's worth looking at the cause of what leads to the irrationality in the first place. This would nip the problem at the bud. Effectively, we want to attack the causal factors leading to evil effects... not blame evil effects hoping that it fixes the cause. So in the case of the unfortunate stories mentioned above, what was the justification (cause) behind the men who commit the crimes of assault and genital mutilation?<br><br><i>Morality</i><br><br>
