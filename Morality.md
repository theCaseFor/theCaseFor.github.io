    <p><br>One of the reasons I felt it was necessary to publicly document my sentiments on many matters (such as objective reality, free will , etc) is because frankly, I haven't been successful in convincing people of the immediate implications they have in the world around us through mere conversation.<br><br>I often get asked after voicing my thoughts the following: <br><br>"What is the point of the existential banter?"<br><br>"Why can't you just live life dude?"<br><br>"You're going to waste your life..."<br><br> While I try not to be dismissive of these suspicions, this is a particularly frustrating dialogue for me because I so clearly see the benefit of coming to terms with the nature of existence. If one can not answer the questions, "what am I doing in life?", "what is the point?", etc, upon what basis can they justify their next decision or advice toward someone else? If we do not come to terms with existential inquiry, we all fall victim to the sheep mentality where anything goes. As we delve into the philosophy of morality, I hope to structure the following passage in a way that illuminates the many ethical fallacies in society today. Moreover, I wish to draw awareness to an abstraction of objective morality as a means to convice the reader of it's neccessity.
